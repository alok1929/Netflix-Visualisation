# Netflix-Visualisation

# Data visualisation using pandas, and matplotlib.

# How to do this:
Download viewing activity from Netflix, as a .csv file, and add it in the second block of my jupyter notebook, and voila.

### How it works:
This data is used to calculate the show you watch the most, and is plotted on a graph. After that, the days it is played is read through the dates it is played on, to find out the days in a week Netflix is used the most.
